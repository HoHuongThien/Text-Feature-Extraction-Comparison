# Text-Feature-Extraction-Comparison
Text feature extraction methods TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GloVe

Feature extraction is the most important step in processing of building Machine Learning model. So there are many methods in text feature extraction were developed.

In this study we have investigated to show the efficiency of four text feature extraction methods.

To validate these efficiency five classifiers have used which are Logistics Regressiong, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and KNN.
